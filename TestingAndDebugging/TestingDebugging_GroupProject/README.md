### What are we doing?

This is a class project for implementing tests for an open source project. We are working with the SuperStarTrek game from the **https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games** open source repo. You can find their details in their README file for the [BASIC Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games) update project!

### Project goals

Implement full testing environment for the game in `Java`, including, but not limited to 

1. `Regression and Unit Testing`
2. `Mutant`
3. `Code Flow Graphs`
4. `Truth Tables`
5. `Test Plans`
6. `Lessons Learned`
