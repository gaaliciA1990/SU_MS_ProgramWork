# Overall Game Mechanics 

Before the game begins, the user will have the option to pick up to six preset characters from each clan, which will go on to battle rounds against six monsters until they reach the Great Leader. The battles are turn-based, where the characters or monsters, who are still alive, in the game have a chance to attack one of the opposing team's players. The turns are based on who has the highest Speed and continue in descending order. The game will continue until every opponent of a team is eliminated.
